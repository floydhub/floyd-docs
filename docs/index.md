Here you'll find comprehensive information for training and deploying your deep learning and AI applications with our platform. We do our best to make this documentation clear and user friendly, but if you have unanswered questions, please visit the [community forum](https://forum.floydhub.com/) or [email us](mailto:support@floydhub.com).

The fastest way to get up and running is to use our [quickstart guide](https://docs.floydhub.com/getstarted/quick_start), which walks through an entire FloydHub training job step-by-step. You'll create a new Project on the FloydHub web dashboard, connect it to a local directory on your computer, and then kick-off a job using the FloydHub CLI to train your deep learning model on FloydHub's GPU servers.

### Frictionless data science
Why worry about provisioning GPUs, installing drivers, or managing software dependency hell? With FloydHub, we take care of your entire deep learning DevOps workflow - so you can focus on the data science.

Training a TensorFlow model using GPUs on the cloud is as simple as executing this command on your terminal:

```
floyd run --gpu --env tensorflow "python train.py"
```

Try it now with our [quickstart guide](https://docs.floydhub.com/getstarted/quick_start).
