Deep Text Corrector is an Tensorflow project made by [Alex Paino](https://github.com/atpaino/deep-text-corrector) for correcting
grammatical errors in short sentences. For example, the message "I'm going to
store" would be unaffected by typical autocorrection systems, when the user
most likely intendend to write "I'm going to *the* store".

In this guide we will train a Tensorflow model for correcting sentences and use
it to evaluate input sentences.  Finally we will deploy the trained model as a
REST endpoint that can be used to evaluate input sequences in real time.


## Project setup

The code for this project is available on Floyd's [Github page](https://github.com/floydhub/deep-text-corrector). Clone the project and
[initialize](../commands/init) a floyd project.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/floydhub/deep-text-corrector
$ cd deep-text-corrector
$ floyd init deep-text-corrector
```


## Training

### Dataset

For this project we will use the Cornel Movie-Dialogs Corpus for training and testing.
The dataset should be preprocessed and split into 3 sets: 80% for training, and 10%
each for validation and testing. This preprocessed dataset is available publicly on
[FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/floydhub/datasets/deep-text-corrector/1).


### Training

You can train the deep corrector model by running `correct_text.py` script with required
parameters. Below is the [command](../commands/run) to start a training job on Floyd:

```bash
$ floyd run --gpu --env tensorflow-0.12:py2 --data floydhub/datasets/deep-text-corrector/1 "python correct_text.py --num_steps 1000 --train_path /input/data/movie_dialog_train.txt --val_path /input/data/movie_dialog_val.txt --config DefaultMovieDialogConfig --data_reader_type MovieDialogReader --output_path /output"
```

Notes:

- The input dataset is passed using the `--data` parameter. This mounts the pre-processed
Cornell Movie Dialog dataset at `/input` path. You will notice that other parameters use files
mounted in this path.
- The data name [floydhub/datasets/deep-text-corrector/1](https://www.floydhub.com/floydhub/datasets/deep-text-corrector/1)
points to the pre-processed dataset on FloydHub.
- The job is running on a gpu instance (Because of the `--gpu` flag).
- This project uses Tensorflow-0.12 installed on Python 2. (See the `--env` flag)

This job takes about 10 minutes to run and generate a model. You can follow along the progress
by using the [logs](../commands/logs.md) command.

```bash
$ floyd logs <JOB_NAME> -t
```

Floyd saves any content stored in the `/output` directory after the job is
finished. This output can be used as a datasource in the next project.  To get
the name of the output generated by your job use the
[info](../commands/info.md) command.

```bash
$ floyd info <JOB_NAME>
```


## Evaluating

To evaluate your model you can run the `correct_text.py` script with the `decode` flag.
You need a file containing short messages for evaluation. The `test.txt` file already has some
inputs. You can update or add more strings to this file - one per line. You also need to
use the output from the training step above as the datasource in this step.

```bash
floyd run --env tensorflow-0.12:py2 --data <REPLACE_WITH_JOB_OUTPUT_NAME> "python correct_text.py --train_path /input/data/movie_dialog_train.txt --test_path test.txt --config DefaultMovieDialogConfig --data_reader_type MovieDialogReader --input_path /input --decode"
```

You can track the status of the run with the status or logs command. The logs should print the
concerted messages from the test.txt file.

```bash
$ floyd status <JOB_NAME>
$ floyd logs <JOB_NAME> -t
```


## Improving your model

You may notice that the output does not look great. In fact, the algorithm would've added more
mistakes into the sentences than correct it. That is because we ran the training for a small number
of iterations. To train a fully working model try the training step again, this time by setting
the flag `num_steps` to a large value. In general, about 20000 steps are necessary to give a
working corrector model. (Note: This takes a few hours to run on the GPU instance)

## Evaluate pre-trained models

If you want to try out a pre-trained model, FloydHub has a public job output for
this. You can mount it with job output name:
[floydhub/deep-text-corrector/23/output](https://www.floydhub.com/floydhub/projects/deep-text-corrector/23/output)
.

```bash
floyd run --env tensorflow-0.12:py2 --data floydhub/deep-text-corrector/23/output "python correct_text.py --train_path /input/data/movie_dialog_train.txt --test_path test.txt --config DefaultMovieDialogConfig --data_reader_type MovieDialogReader --input_path /input --decode"
```

This model should perform better on the given inputs compared to the previous one.


## Rest API

Coming Soon!


## What Next?

The model was trained using movie dialogues which are not the greatest sources of gramatically correct
sentences. An improvement to this approach would be to use other datasources like [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
This project was also discussed on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13350972) and you can
find lots of interesting alternatives there.
