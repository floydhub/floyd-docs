## Using virtualenv to install floyd-cli

We highly recommend using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/) for installing and using `floyd-cli`. This helps avoid any library version conflicts and results in a smoother installation process. When you use 'sudo', don't worry if some messages appears because root is not the owner of the /home/user_name/floyd dir.

```bash
sudo pip install virtualenv
```

To create a virtualenv, you need to pass a path to store the installed packages.

```bash
virtualenv ~/floyd
```

You can now activate and start using the virtualenv by running:
```bash
source ~/floyd/bin/activate
```

To install floyd-cli in this virtualenv:

```bash
pip install -U floyd-cli
```

You are now ready to use the [floyd commands](http://docs.floydhub.com/commands/). Note: You need to activate your virtualenv using the `source` command above each time you open a new terminal and want to use `floyd-cli` in it.
