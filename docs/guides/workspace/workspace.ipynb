    "Workspace is an interactive environment ([Jupyter Lab](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906)) for developing and running code. You can run Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts and much more. All the files and data in your workspace will be preserved for you, across restarts. You can think of it as your persistent, on-demand machine on the cloud.\n",
