In this guide, we will explain how to attach a datasource to your job.

## Datasets

Floyd datasets are directories of data files that can be used in a project run. To create a new dataset, please follow 
[this guide](../basics/create_new/#create-a-new-dataset). You can view the datasets you 
have created in the [datasets page](https://www.floydhub.com/datasets) in the dashboard. You can also view 
public datasets by searching for it on FloydHub.

## Mounting datasets

### Overview

You can mount one or more datasets when you run a job using the [floyd run](../../commands/run) command. 
This automatically makes the mounted datasets available for you to use in your job, without having to download them each time.

To mount a specific version of a dataset, you need to specify its [full name](#datasource-name) and the [mount point](#mount-point). 
The syntax is `--data <data_name>:<mount_point>`

For example, to mount the [VGG 19-layers](https://www.floydhub.com/floydhub/datasets/vgg-ilsvrc-19-layers/1) dataset under `/vgg`:
```bash
floyd run --data floydhub/datasets/vgg-ilsvrc-19-layers/1:vgg --mode jupyter
```

This will spin up a Jupyter Notebook, inside which you will have access to the VGGNet pre-trained models under `/vgg`.

*Note*: You can use the `--data` flag with `floyd run` when you are running a command too.

```bash
$ floyd run --data floydhub/datasets/vgg-ilsvrc-19-layers/1:vgg "python train.py"
```


### Mounting the output of another job

In FloydHub, you can link jobs by mounting the output of one job as the input of a new job that you are going to run. This allows you to derive from an existing job or restart a stopped or timedout job.

You can refer to the output of a job by its name with `/output` appended to it.

For example: `floydhub/projects/handwriting-recognition/12/output` refers to the output of the job `floydhub/projects/handwriting-recognition/12`

You can mount this using the `--data` flag in the `floyd run` command, similar to datasets. For example:

```bash
$ floyd run --data floydhub/projects/handwriting-recognition/12/output:filtered_training_data "python train.py"
```

This will make the output of `floydhub/projects/handwriting-recognition/12` available at `/filtered_training_data` for the new job to use.

*Note*: You need to have access to the job to be able to mount it's output.


### Mounting multiple datasources

You can attach upto 5 datasources when you run a job using the `--data` flag in the [floyd run](../../commands/run) command. This includes both datasets and job outputs. Ensure that the mount points for the datasets are unique.

```bash
$ floyd run --data floydhub/datasets/mnist/2:training --data floydhub/datasets/digits/1:test "python script.py"
```
In this case, the above datasets will be mounted at `/training` and `/test` respectively.


### Web dashboard

You can view the mounted datasets and their respective mount points for a specific job by going to the `Data` tab:

### Symlinking your mounted data

Sometimes, your code might require your data to be available at a hardcoded location. Or you might want to combine multiple mounted datasources under a single directory. One way to do this would be to copy the data from the mounted locations to the destination, but this is inefficient for large data. [Symlinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) is a great solution for this.

Please see this guide: [Symlinking mounted data](./symlink_mounted_data)
### Details

#### Datasource name

The full name of a datasource (`<username>/datasets/<dataset_name>/<version>`) consists of 3 parts: 

- Username
- Dataset Name
- Version

For example: `floydhub/datasets/mnist/2`

#### Mount point

The mount point is the name of the directory under which the datasource will be available in your job. 

- It *cannot* contain subdirectories. `vgg` is a valid mount point, but `vgg/2017` is not.
- The mount point is an absolute path. For example, `--data floydhub/datasets/vgg-ilsvrc-19-layers/1:vgg` will mount the data at `/vgg`. A common mistake is to look for the mounted data in the current directory (`./vgg`), rather than using the absolute path (`/vgg`)

#### Default mount points

We highly recommend that you explicitly specify the mount points for your data using the `--data <data_name>:<mount_point>` convention.

If, however, you do not specify a mount point, the default values are:

- Single data mount: If you only mount one datasource without specifying a mount point, it is mounted at `/input`

- Multiple data mounts: If you mount multiple datasource without specifying mount points, they will each be mounted under their respective GUIDs (e.g. `/xKduBzTr4LAsc6eVPZVPVd`). GUIDs are 32-character random strings that difficult to track down, so we highly discourage this pattern.
